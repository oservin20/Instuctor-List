# Instuctor-List
This program deals with a list of instructors and allows user to manipulate the data inside the linked list. The user is able to add, remove, display, and sort a list of instructors. Before the program is terminated, it will save all of instructors into a file. When the program is ran again, it will check if a file with a list of instructors already exists and will proceed to load the information.
